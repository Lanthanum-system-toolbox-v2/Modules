 text=What is SELinux?\n In simple words, it is a protection of Android, which makes an app more independent from others.
 For example, when you use RE to modify the thread quantity of ADM, you get a success response but actuall never make it, then you find the file has been recovered. That is just what SELinux has done.
 Another case is the 0MHz in a perfomance monitor, it failed to read data due to not enough permission. Generally it is OK to disable it, as for aftercoming, exaggeratingly, more vulnerable to a malware and easier to get your data falsified. On some ROM this can cause a bootloop, so TAKE GREAT CARE!!!
